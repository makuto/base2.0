EPT SPECIFICATION
----------------
-Format:
<fileName.version>
//Comment (SEE NOTE!)
groupName:
	attribute=value;

-WARNING! Attributes are sorted in the map, meaning if you have any
 order dependency, you must be conscious of the attribute's name!
 
-Value can be anything. Values are terminated by ";", so no quotation
 marks are necessary or needed for strings. To EPT, ints, strings, etc.
 are all the same thing as they are stored as mere strings.
-Multiline attributes are supported; everything will be extracted until the next semicolon
-Header is space sensitive

-Using : is NOT OK in an attribute definition! This is mainly a result of the
 precendence I coded for, so it's probably not *that* hard to change if you need to

-NOTE! Comments use "//" and operate on the ENTIRE line! This means that
 test=This is a test; //Here is an example attribute
 will IGNORE THE ENTIRE LINE!
 
-It is NOT OK to use "." in a group definition (think about dotted notation). "." is OK
 in an attribute name or definition.
 
-A group definition ends the instant a line contains a ':' (a new group definition)
